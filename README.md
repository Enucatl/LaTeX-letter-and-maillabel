# PSI letter template for LaTeX

## Write a letter
* Edit your details in `PSI-Letter-Template.tex`
* You should not have to edit `psi.lco` which takes care of the letter design.
* Write the letter instead of the `\lipsum` blind text

## Send a parcel
* Edit your details in `psilabel.lco`
* Write an address label with `PSI-AddressLabel-Template.tex`
* compile `latexmk -pdf PSI-...`
* print and glue to the parcel and put it in the `Post Ausgang` area in the hallway.
